## 1. Landmark Classification Model

For landmark classification model, we created 2 kinds of model :
1. Model made from scratch
2. Model with transfer learning using InceptionV3.

**Model Made From Scratch**<br />
For the first model, we made basic image classification model with 5 layers of convolutional neural network. With dataset around 665 total images for 6 classes, we achieved **0.9167 validation accuracy** and **0.3701 validation loss**. We understand that this dataset is far from sufficient from creating a perfect model since we struggle an overfitting after several tuning.
